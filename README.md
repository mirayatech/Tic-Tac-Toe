# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript 🔢

# About this project 🚀
When the user chooses who he wants to be (X or O), the select-box will disappear and the playboard will be visible. At the top of the board section are player names (X or O) that indicate or show whose turn it is now. In the center of the page there is a tic-tac-toe play area with nine square boxes. When you click on a box, the character you selected in the selection field is visible.

After clicking on any box, after a few seconds, the bot will automatically select the box that has not been previously selected by you or the bot, and the opposite icon is visible means that if your icon is "X", the bot will have an "O". Once a match is won by someone, the playboard will be hidden and the result box appears with the winner sign or icon and a replay button.

If no one wins the match and all nine-box selected then again the playboard section is hidden and the result box appears with “Match has been drawn text” and a replay button. When you click the replay button, the current page will be reloaded and you can play again.
